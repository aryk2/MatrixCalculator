#Matrix Calculator Suite

This matrix calculator program is a combination of some of the most
important matrix operations, as studied in my linear algebra class. 
These operations are grouped into the single matrix or two matrix
catagory. Single matrix operations only require one input matrix while 
the other catagory requires 2. 

the following operations are working as expected:
addition / subtraction
multiplication
row echelon form
reduced row echelon form
determinant 
scalar multiplcation

the inverse function is still being programmed and the current result 
does not provide the exactly correct inverse of a matrix. 

The matrix suite cpp file allows a user to access the functions and 
input matrices. The operation is then called and the result is displayed.
